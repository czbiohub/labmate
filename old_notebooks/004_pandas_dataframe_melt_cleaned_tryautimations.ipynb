The .format method sets an empty pair of curly brackets to be combined with /csv. The argument in .format is the variable that will be passed into those empty brackets. You could also write this as `all_csv=glob.glob(\"{my_path}/*.csv\".format(my_path=path)` or `all_csv=glob.glob(f\"{path}/*.csv\")`. \n",
    "\n",
    "2a) `.format` method explained. This is a method used on strings. In the case above, we created a string with an empty set of brackets for which the path to the csv is needed. Using the .format method on this string allows you to pass an argument into this method that will fill in the value placed in the argument in the location in the string where the empty bracket placeholders are. This is useful here because it allows us to change the `path` vairable in the above code to collect files from any pre-designated path which we save to the variable `path`.\n",

    "#### Change dataframes from 96 well format to long format where A1-H12 is one column and merge all of these dfs together. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we want to use the pd.melt function to get the variable and value name associated with each cell in the 96 well plates. We do this by calling the pd.melt function on our 96 well plate format and specifying the id vairable ( id_vars) for which we want to get the associated values from each column. In this case we want to know for every value in the column Unnamed: 0, which is out list of row lables(A-H), what is the associated value for each column of the plate. We specify this by identifying the id_vars as the column containing the row letters. We do not specify a value_vars since we want to do this for all of the columns and doing so for all columns id the default. We specify var_name as the name we want to give for the list of alll the column numbers and value_name as the name of the value inside of each well. In this case, we specify value name as `file_name` which is the temporary variable name given to our dictionary keys as it iterates though every key, value pair in our dictionary. Thus, for each iteration, we will name the value column after the file_name from which the dataframe came. Everytime we melt our dataframe, we also want to create a new column called \"well_id\" which will combine the row name and column number for each well. This is done by adding a new column to the dataframe and specifying the values for that column. Finally, since we have the well_id column, we can remove the colum with the rows and cols separateley indicated for each item in the dataframe. We do this by passing the df into the function remove_cols() which we defined above. This function takes in one argument, your df,and removed the list of columns specified in the variable, cols_to_drop along the column axis (axis 1). If we pass our df into the function in the below loop, we will return a df that has the columns dropped, we can then add this df to the empty dictionary tidy_files by specifying the file_name (key from our dict_of_dicts dictionary) as the key for the new df (relating to the value associated with that key (data_frame) which has been transformed into a long format and had the specified columns dropped. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we want to put all of these columns together. There is not an easy way to do this in python as most functions take only two items and we want to merge many tidy dfs together. For this we will need the reduce function. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reduce function takes in two arguments, one is a function and the other is a list of values over which you want to reduce. The reduce function reduces all the values in that list to one value following what is specified by the function. How this works is that reduce first take out the first element in your list, this is the set up for the reduce function. It then does something with that element and the next element in the list, as specified by the function you select, and returns an item that is of the same type as the elements in your list, which is a new item that has had the function performed on the first two items in the list. Now this new element will be used as the input to the remove function where it will perform the function on this new item and the next item in the list. In this way you iterate through all items in the list combining them based on the function of choice. In the case below what we want to do is merge the dataframes together based on the column \"well_id\". We use lambda, to create an unnamed function within our script that takes in two arguments, left and right, on these arguments, it will perform the merge function, which takes in two dataframes, left and right, and merges them based on the specification in the function call, in this case, on well_id.

In this case, we want the values for all other variables, which are all other collumns, because we did not specify a specific subset of variables. If we wanted to specify this subset we could use value_vars and pass in a list of the other collumns (variables) that we want to see the values for relative to column 0. For example, if we only selected collumn 1, we would see the values at each position in the id_vars collumn from the corresponding index position in column 1. We can name these columns for clarity. \n",
